        <h4>
          What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter
        </h4>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type
          "google.com" in your browser and hit Enter? The seemingly simple
          action triggers a complex series of interactions involving various
          components of the internet infrastructure. In this article, we will
          take a closer look at each step of the journey, emphasizing the core
          areas of DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load-balancers, web
          servers, application servers, and databases. Let's dive in!

          <span class="full-content hidden"></span>
          <div>
            <img src="/image/google.jpg">
        </p>
        <div>
          <h4>DNS (Domain Name System)</h4>
          <p>As you enter "google.com" in your browser, the first key player in the process is the Domain Name System (DNS). Your computer sends a DNS request to a DNS resolver, asking for the IP address associated with "google.com." The resolver navigates through a hierarchy of DNS servers to obtain the IP address. Here's a simplified breakdown:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your computer queries a local DNS resolver (usually provided by your ISP or configured manually).
            </li>
            <li>The resolver checks its cache. If it doesn't have the IP address, it sends a request to the root DNS server.
            </li>
            <li>The root server directs the resolver to the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) server responsible for ".com" domains.
            </li>
            <li>The TLD server, in turn, points the resolver to the authoritative DNS server responsible for "google.com."</li>
            <li>The authoritative server provides the IP address back to the resolver, which then caches it for future use.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div>
            <img src="/image/dns.jpg">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)</h4>
          <p>Once the browser has obtained the IP address of "google.com" from the DNS resolution, 
            it proceeds with establishing a connection using TCP/IP. TCP breaks the data into packets, while IP handles routing and addressing. The browser initiates a TCP connection with the web server at the IP address obtained.
          </p>

            <img src="/image/tcp.jpg">
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Firewall</h4>
            <p>In the journey to "google.com," firewalls act as security gatekeepers. 
              They monitor and filter network traffic to protect against unauthorized 
              access and potential threats. When the browser sends a request to the web server, 
              it passes through firewalls that examine the request for any potential security 
              risks before allowing it to proceed.
            </p>

              <img src="/image/firewall.jpg">
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>HTTPS/SSL (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure/Secure Sockets Layer)</h4>
            <p>To ensure secure communication, websites like Google utilize HTTPS/SSL 
              encryption. As the connection is established between your browser and the 
              web server, the server presents a digital certificate verifying its identity. 
              Your browser checks the certificate's authenticity and initiates an SSL handshake 
              to establish an encrypted connection. This encryption protects your data from 
              interception and maintains privacy.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Load Balancer</h4>
            <p>Google, being a highly trafficked website, employs load-balancers to distribute
               incoming requests across multiple servers. Load-balancers help optimize performance, 
               ensure high availability, and prevent any single server from being overwhelmed. When 
               you visit "google.com," the load-balancer routes your request to an available web 
               server to handle the incoming traffic.
            </p>
            <div>
              <img src="image/loadbalancer.jpg">
            </div>
            
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Web Server</h4>
              <p>Once the request reaches a web server, it processes the request and generates 
                the appropriate response. The web server retrieves the requested web page and 
                sends it back to your browser over the established connection. Google employs 
                robust web servers capable of handling millions of simultaneous requests efficiently.

          <div>
            <h4>Application Server</h4>
            <p>In more complex web applications, an application server comes into play. It processes 
              dynamic content, executes server-side code, and interacts with databases. For example, 
              Google's search functionality involves an application server that handles the search request, 
              processes the query, and retrieves relevant results.

        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Database</h4>
          <p>Behind the scenes, a database stores and manages the vast amount of information needed to power 
            websites like Google. When you search for something, the application server queries the database 
            to retrieve relevant results. Databases play a crucial
